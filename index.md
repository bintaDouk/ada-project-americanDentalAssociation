## Background and motivation
Ever since the begining of cinematography, movies have often been a reflection of reality. Whether it is through romance stories or tragedies, fiction has been used as a way to mirror real life situation.
This tendency also applies to crises, as they are major events that impact the socio-economic status of the world, as well as peoples' daily lives. It is only natural to ask ourselves how these very particular events are mirrored in movies, and how well these depictions are received by the public.

Using the CMU Movie Dataset, we will answer the following research questions:
1. How do global crises and significant world events shape film production, themes, and public preferences?
2. How do movie genre preferences differ between countries in conflict or those experiencing similar global events?
3. How does the portrayal of historical events in movies vary based on the country of production?
4. How do global events like natural disasters, pandemics, and wars influence public preferences for specific themes and genres?
